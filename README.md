# Point Cloud Shoeprint Classification

This repository provides the implementation of a deep learning architecture for 3D shoeprint point cloud classification.
It combines **Multi-Scale Set Abstraction (MSA)** and **Channel & Spatial Attention(CAS)** for enhanced feature extraction.

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

- Multi-branch MSA layers
- CAS attention mechanism at shallow layer
- Global feature pooling and classification

## ðŸ—ƒ Dataset Format

Your dataset should follow this structure:
```
data_root/
â”œâ”€â”€ 1/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 1_1.xyz
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 1_2.xyz
â”œâ”€â”€ 2/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 2_1.xyz
...
```
- Each `.xyz` file contains 3D points in text format.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set your dataset path in `Config.data_root` in `train.py` and run training:
```
python train.py
```
